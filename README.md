## 🚀 Overview

A modern, responsive web application built with React and TypeScript that gamifies the learning experience. This educational platform allows students to solve questions, earn points, compete in rankings, while providing an engaging and interactive interface for both educational and entertainment content.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Core Functionality

- **Interactive Learning Games**: Subject-specific questions with real-time feedback
- **Entertainment Quizzes**: General knowledge games across multiple categories
- **Dynamic Ranking System**: Live leaderboards with point-based scoring
- **Multi-Role Dashboard**: Tailored interfaces for different user types
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant feedback and live ranking updates

### 🎮 Game Types

#### **Five Hints** 🔍

Five Hints is a thrilling guessing game where you test your knowledge by uncovering the correct answer with minimal hints! You start with no clues, and every 10 seconds, a new hint is revealed. The faster you guess, the higher your rank! If you crack the mystery on the first try, you'll achieve the top rank. But beware—every additional hint lowers your score. Can you solve the puzzle before all hints are revealed? Challenge yourself and climb the leaderboard!

#### **Offside** ⚖️

Offside is a fast-paced logic game that tests your ability to distinguish between truth and deception! You start with 50 points and are presented with six statements—some are true, and some are false. Your goal is to identify the correct ones while avoiding the false ones. But be careful! Every wrong choice deducts points from your score. Can you keep your score high and make the right calls? Challenge yourself and prove your sharp judgment!

#### **The Question Journey** 🗺️

In each round, you'll receive 6 questions from easiest to hardest — answer them correctly to win! Progress through increasingly challenging questions as you test your knowledge across different difficulty levels.
