You start with no clues, and every 30 seconds, a new hint is revealed. The faster you guess, the higher your rank! If you crack the mystery on the first try, you'll achieve the top rank. But beware—every additional hint lowers your score. Can you solve the puzzle before all hints are revealed? Challenge yourself and climb the leaderboard!",
